# Sage AI — Premium Enterprise Workspace Assistant

Sage AI is a high-performance, production-grade research and workspace assistant built on Cloudflare's global network. It leverages Durable Objects for stateful context and Cloudflare AI (Llama 3.1) for sophisticated enterprise-level reasoning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Stateful Intelligence**: Durable Object-backed conversation history for persistent, context-aware assistance.
- **Enterprise Speed**: Zero-latency global routing across Cloudflare's edge network.
- **Multi-Tool Integration**:
    - 🔍 **Global البحث (Search)**: Real-time intelligence via DuckDuckGo API.
    - ⏰ **Smart Reminders**: Precision scheduling using Durable Object Alarms.
    - 🌐 **Env Awareness**: Browser-level context (timezone, locale) for personalized help.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: High-end UX with glassmorphic UI, fluid animations, and dark-mode elegance.

## 🏗 System Architecture

Sage AI is engineered for scalability and low-latency:
- **State Layer**: Durable Objects provide 100% consistency for user sessions.
- **Inference Layer**: Direct integration with `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`.
